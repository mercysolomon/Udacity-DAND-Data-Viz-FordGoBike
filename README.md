## by Mercy Solomon


## Dataset
> This dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area for the duration of Febraury 2019.


## Summary of Findings

> I was interested in finding observations related to the duration in minutes of the trips and some of those findings include:
- Males make up 74.6 of the users while females make up 23.3%.
- Males are more likely to share bikes for all trip than females.
- Most of the users are between the ages 20-40.
- There are more rides recorded during the weekday than the weekends.

## Insights
> I found insights to a couple of questions, some of which include:
- What is the gender distribution of the users?
- Is there any relationship between gender and bike share for all trips?
- What is the age distribution of the users?
- What day of the week is the service often used?
